initially we did jsx transforms in the browser following the examples
in the react quick-start tutorials.

better, however, to do the page builds separately, perhaps. so that's
how index.html and friends are configured now.

run this to keep the jsx/ and js/ subdirectories in sync

  jsx -w jsx/ js/

we're also loading a browserify'ed bundle of core turtle-svg code. we
make that by bundling the core js src from our master branch and
popping the bundle over here into the gh-pages branch

  browserify js-src/turtle-svg-main.js \
    -o ~/hs-js-turtle-pages/js/turtle-svg-bundle.js

we have two index.html files. 'index.html' is the "production" page
(such as it is). 'index-dev.html' should be the same except that it
uses an un-minified react.js. for now we can keep the two in sync by
hand.
