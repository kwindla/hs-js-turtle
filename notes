initially we did jsx transforms in the browser following the examples
in the react quick-start tutorials.

better, however, to do the page builds separately, perhaps. so that's
how index.html and friends are configured now.

run this to keep the jsx/ and js/ subdirectories in sync

  jsx -w jsx/ js/

we're also browserifying the stuff in the js directory to make a
single app bundle. from the js directory ...

  /usr/local/share/npm/bin/browserify app.js -o app-bundle.js
